# Worldline Connect - Flutter SDK

**This SDK has been rebranded to Worldline. As part of the rebranding the SDK has moved to https://github.com/Worldline-Global-Collect/connect-sdk-client-flutter.**

The Worldline Connect Flutter SDK provides a convenient way to support a large number of payments methods inside your Flutter app.
It is Dart 3 compatible out of the box. 

See the [Worldline Connect Developer Hub](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/documentation/sdk/mobile/flutter/) for more information on how to use the SDK.

## Installation via pub.dev
Add the SDK to your app by adding the dependency to your pubspec.yaml file, where `x.y.z` is the version number:

```yaml
    dependencies:
        # other dependencies
        connect_sdk_client_flutter: ^x.y.z
        
```
Afterwards, run the following command:
`flutter pub get`
